# Unassigned Tasks Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses the requirement to make unassigned tasks visible on the TaskBoard. Previously, tasks without an assignee might not have been properly displayed or filtered. Now, unassigned tasks are fully supported and visible throughout the application.

## Problem Statement

The user requested that unassigned tasks should be visible on the TaskBoard and only be removed when they are actually deleted, not when they become unassigned.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Task Interface

**Location**: `src/types/index.ts`

Made the `assigneeId` field optional in the Task interface:

```typescript
export interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: StatusCode;
  priority: Priority;
  assigneeId?: string; // Made optional to allow unassigned tasks
  clientId: string;
  team: TeamType;
  dueDate: string;
  createdAt: string;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced TaskBoard Filtering

**Location**: `src/pages/TaskBoard.tsx`

#### Added "Unassigned" Filter Option

- Added a new filter option "Unassigned Tasks" to the employee filter dropdown
- Updated filtering logic to handle unassigned tasks:

```typescript
if (employeeFilter !== 'all') {
  if (employeeFilter === 'unassigned') {
    // Show only unassigned tasks (tasks without assigneeId)
    filtered = filtered.filter(task => !task.assigneeId);
  } else {
    // Show tasks assigned to specific employee
    filtered = filtered.filter(task => task.assigneeId === employeeFilter);
  }
}
```

#### Updated Filter Tags Display

- Enhanced the filter tags to properly show when "Unassigned Tasks" filter is active
- Displays "Unassigned Tasks" instead of trying to find a user name

### 3. Enhanced Task Creation

**Location**: `src/components/tasks/NewTaskModal.tsx`

#### Removed Assignee Requirement

- Removed the validation requirement for `assigneeId`
- Added "Unassigned" option to the assignee dropdown:

```typescript
const userOptions = [
  { value: '', label: 'Unassigned' }, // Add unassigned option
  ...teamUsers.map(user => ({
    value: user.id,
    label: user.name
  }))
];
```

- Removed the `required` attribute from the assignee Select component

### 4. Enhanced Task Display

**Location**: `src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx`

#### Visual Indicator for Unassigned Tasks

- Added proper handling for unassigned tasks in the TaskCard component
- Fixed TypeScript error by checking if `assigneeId` exists before calling `getUserById`
- Added visual indicator for unassigned tasks:

```typescript
{assignee ? (
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <Avatar 
      src={assignee.avatar} 
      name={assignee.name} 
      size="xs" 
    />
    <span className="ml-1.5 text-xs font-medium text-secondary-700">{assignee.name}</span>
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <div className="w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-gray-200 flex items-center justify-center">
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">?</span>
    </div>
    <span className="ml-1.5 text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 italic">Unassigned</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## Features

### 1. Unassigned Task Visibility

- **All Tasks View**: When employee filter is set to "All", unassigned tasks are visible alongside assigned tasks
- **Unassigned Filter**: New "Unassigned Tasks" filter option to view only unassigned tasks
- **Visual Distinction**: Unassigned tasks show a gray placeholder avatar with "?" and "Unassigned" text

### 2. Task Creation

- **Optional Assignee**: Tasks can be created without selecting an assignee
- **Unassigned Option**: "Unassigned" option is available in the assignee dropdown
- **No Validation Error**: No validation error when creating tasks without an assignee

### 3. Task Management

- **Persistent Visibility**: Unassigned tasks remain visible on TaskBoard until explicitly deleted
- **Assignee Updates**: Tasks can be updated to add or remove assignees
- **Filtering Flexibility**: Users can filter by specific employees, all employees, or unassigned tasks

## Database Compatibility

The implementation is fully compatible with the existing database schema:

- The `assignee_id` field in the database can be `NULL`
- The task service properly handles optional `assigneeId` values
- No database migrations are required

## User Experience

### For Managers/Admins

1. **Task Assignment**: Can create tasks without immediately assigning them
2. **Workload Management**: Can see unassigned tasks that need to be distributed
3. **Filtering**: Can quickly filter to see only unassigned tasks

### For Team Members

1. **Task Visibility**: Can see all tasks including unassigned ones when viewing "All" tasks
2. **Clear Indication**: Unassigned tasks are clearly marked with visual indicators
3. **No Confusion**: Won't see unassigned tasks when filtering by their own name

## Technical Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript support for optional assigneeId
2. **Error Prevention**: No runtime errors when handling unassigned tasks
3. **Consistent UI**: Uniform display of assigned and unassigned tasks
4. **Flexible Filtering**: Comprehensive filtering options for different use cases

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:

- Unassigned tasks are visible in TaskBoard
- Filtering works correctly for all scenarios
- Task creation works with and without assignees
- Visual indicators display properly
- No TypeScript or runtime errors occur

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Bulk Assignment**: Ability to assign multiple unassigned tasks at once
2. **Assignment Notifications**: Notify users when tasks are assigned to them
3. **Unassigned Task Metrics**: Dashboard showing count of unassigned tasks
4. **Auto-Assignment**: Rules-based automatic assignment of tasks

# User Role-Based Restrictions Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the role-based access controls implemented for normal users vs administrators in the PM Tool attendance and calendar systems.

## Attendance Module Restrictions

### Admin Users (Full Access)
- **View Scope**: Can view attendance data for ALL employees across all teams
- **Filters Available**: 
  - Team filter (All Teams, Creative Team, Web Team)
  - Employee filter (All Employees, Individual Selection)
  - Export attendance reports functionality
- **Data Access**: Complete overview of organization-wide attendance patterns
- **UI Elements**: Full filter controls, export buttons, admin-specific insights

### Normal Users (Personal View Only)
- **View Scope**: Can ONLY view their own attendance data
- **Restrictions Applied**:
  - No team filter options (locked to personal data)
  - No employee selection dropdown 
  - No export functionality
  - Cannot see other team members or colleagues
- **UI Elements**: 
  - Simplified personal dashboard card showing user info
  - Personal attendance details only
  - Current time display
  - Check-in/check-out functionality for self only
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - "ðŸ”’ Personal Dashboard" badge
  - "Personal View - Your attendance data only" text
  - Clear indication this is restricted access

## Calendar Module Restrictions

### Admin Users (Full Access)
- **Team Toggle**: Can switch between Creative, Web, and All Teams
- **Client Access**: Can view and manage tasks for clients from any team
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations on all tasks
- **Export**: Can export calendar data for any team/client

### Normal Users (Team-Restricted)
- **Team Lock**: Automatically locked to their assigned team (Creative or Web)
- **Client Access**: Can only see clients assigned to their team
- **Task Management**: Can only create/edit/delete tasks for their team's clients
- **UI Restrictions**: No team toggle buttons shown (admin-only feature)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Service Changes
```typescript
// attendanceService.ts - Updated filtering function
export const getFilteredUsersForAttendance = (
  allUsers: any[],
  currentUserRole: string,
  currentUserTeam: string,
  currentUserId: string
): any[] => {
  if (currentUserRole === 'admin') {
    // Admins can see all users
    return allUsers;
  } else {
    // Normal users can ONLY see themselves
    return allUsers.filter(user => user.id === currentUserId);
  }
};
```

### Frontend UI Changes
- **Conditional Filter Rendering**: Filters only shown to admins
- **Personal Dashboard**: New UI component for normal users showing limited view
- **Role Indicators**: Clear visual indicators of access level
- **Messaging**: Context-appropriate messages based on user role

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Privacy**: Normal users cannot access colleagues' attendance data
2. **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between admin and user capabilities
3. **Reduced UI Complexity**: Normal users see simplified, focused interface
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear logging of who accesses what data with role context

## User Experience Impact

### For Normal Users
- **Simplified Interface**: No overwhelming options or data they shouldn't see
- **Personal Focus**: Clear focus on their own attendance tracking
- **Intuitive Design**: UI clearly indicates personal vs admin access
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less options = easier navigation

### For Administrators
- **Full Control**: Complete oversight and management capabilities
- **Advanced Features**: Export, filtering, team management
- **Clear Admin Indicators**: UI clearly shows admin-level access
- **Comprehensive View**: Organization-wide insights and controls

## Calendar Module Team Restrictions

The Calendar module already had appropriate team-based restrictions:

- **Normal Users**: Automatically assigned to their team's client pool
- **Task Visibility**: Only see tasks for clients in their team
- **Client Dropdown**: Only shows clients from their assigned team
- **Team Toggle**: Hidden for normal users (admin-only feature)

## Technical Implementation Notes

- **Service Layer**: Core filtering logic implemented in attendance service
- **Component Level**: UI conditionally renders based on user role
- **Context Aware**: All restrictions respect current user context
- **Type Safe**: TypeScript interfaces ensure proper data handling
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering reduces unnecessary data loading

## Future Considerations

1. **Granular Permissions**: Could expand to project-specific access controls
2. **Team Lead Roles**: Intermediate role between normal user and admin
3. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced tracking of access patterns
4. **API Security**: Backend endpoint restrictions to match frontend controls

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the database migration to create the necessary tables:

```bash
# Option 1: Run the migration script
node run_reports_migration.js

# Option 2: Manual SQL execution
# Copy the SQL from src/sql/create_reports_analytics_tables.sql
# and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Ensure your environment variables are configured:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key (optional)
```

### 3. Navigation Setup

The module is automatically added to the sidebar navigation as "Reports & Analytics" and is accessible to all authenticated users.

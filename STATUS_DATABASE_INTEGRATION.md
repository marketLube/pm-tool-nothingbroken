# Status Management Database Integration

## 🎯 Overview

The status management system has been successfully integrated with the database to ensure that status configurations set by admins are consistent and shared across all users in the webapp.

## 🔄 Migration from localStorage to Database

### Previous Implementation
- ✅ Status configurations were stored in browser's localStorage
- ❌ Data was not shared between users or devices
- ❌ No centralized management
- ❌ Data could be lost if localStorage was cleared

### New Implementation
- ✅ Status configurations are stored in Supabase database
- ✅ Data is shared across all users and devices
- ✅ Centralized admin management
- ✅ localStorage used as backup/fallback for offline functionality
- ✅ Real-time updates across the application

## 📊 Database Schema

### `statuses` Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE statuses (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- Unique status identifier
  name TEXT NOT NULL,                     -- Display name of the status
  team TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (team IN ('creative', 'web')), -- Team assignment
  color TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Hex color code for UI
  "order" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,     -- Display order within team
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes for Performance
- `idx_statuses_team` - Fast filtering by team
- `idx_statuses_order` - Fast ordering operations
- `idx_statuses_team_order` - Combined team and order queries

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Read Access**: All authenticated users can view statuses
- **Write Access**: Only admins can create, update, or delete statuses

### RLS Policies
```sql
-- Anyone can view statuses
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view statuses" ON statuses FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Only admins can modify statuses
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can insert statuses" ON statuses
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.id::text = auth.uid()::text AND users.role = 'admin')
  );
```

## 🚀 Features

### Admin Features
1. **Create Status**: Add new workflow statuses for teams
2. **Edit Status**: Modify name, color, and properties
3. **Delete Status**: Remove unused statuses (with safety checks)
4. **Reorder Status**: Drag and drop to change workflow order
5. **Team Management**: Separate status workflows for Creative and Web teams

### User Features
1. **View Status**: See current status configurations
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes made by admins are immediately visible
3. **Offline Fallback**: localStorage backup ensures functionality during network issues

### Technical Features
1. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during database operations
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with retry options
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with database sync
4. **Validation**: Duplicate name prevention and data validation

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### StatusContext Integration
```typescript
// Database-first approach with localStorage fallback
const loadStatusesFromDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    const dbStatuses = await statusService.getStatuses();
    setStatuses(dbStatuses);
    saveStatusesToStorage(dbStatuses); // Backup to localStorage
  } catch (err) {
    // Fallback to localStorage if database fails
    const fallbackStatuses = loadStatusesFromStorage();
    setStatuses(fallbackStatuses);
  }
};
```

### StatusService API
- `getStatuses()` - Fetch all statuses from database
- `getStatusesByTeam(team)` - Get statuses for specific team
- `addStatus(status)` - Create new status
- `updateStatus(id, updates)` - Update existing status
- `deleteStatus(id)` - Delete status (with safety checks)

## 📱 User Experience

### Status Management UI
1. **Edit Mode**: Click "Edit Order" to enable drag and drop
2. **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive reordering with visual feedback
3. **Save Changes**: Explicit save action with loading states
4. **Team Switching**: Automatic exit from edit mode when switching teams
5. **Error Recovery**: Retry buttons and fallback mechanisms

### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinners during database operations
- Success/error messages for user actions
- Real-time order updates during drag operations
- Disabled states during save operations

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Status Creation Flow
1. Admin fills out status form
2. Client validates input (duplicate check)
3. Database insert via statusService
4. Local state update
5. localStorage backup
6. UI refresh with new status

### Status Reordering Flow
1. Admin enters edit mode
2. Drag and drop to reorder
3. Local pending state update
4. Click save to persist
5. Batch database updates
6. Exit edit mode
7. UI refresh with new order

## 🛠 Maintenance

### Default Statuses
The system includes predefined statuses for both teams:

**Creative Team (8 statuses):**
- Not Started → Scripting → Script Confirmed → Shoot Pending → Shoot Finished → Edit Pending → Client Approval → Approved

**Web Team (10 statuses):**
- Proposal Awaiting → Not Started → UI Started → UI Finished → Development Started → Development Finished → Testing → Handed Over → Client Reviewing → Completed

### Database Maintenance
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates via triggers
- Referential integrity checks before status deletion
- Performance monitoring via database indexes

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Network Issues
- Automatic fallback to localStorage
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- User-friendly error messages

### Data Conflicts
- Duplicate name prevention
- Order conflict resolution
- Graceful degradation

### Admin Safety
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Usage checks before status deletion
- Rollback capabilities

# 🔧 Edit User Button Fix - Issue Resolved

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
The "Edit User" button was not visible in the Users table because of a **permissions mismatch**.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
- **Users.tsx** was checking for `action: 'update'` permission
- **permissions.ts** only defined `action: 'edit'` permission
- The `PermissionGuard` component was blocking the button from rendering

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Missing 'update' Permission for Admins**
```typescript
// In permissions.ts - Admin permissions
{ resource: 'user', action: 'update', team: 'all' },
```

### **2. Added Missing 'update' Permission for Managers** 
```typescript
// In permissions.ts - Manager permissions  
{ resource: 'user', action: 'update', team: userTeam },
```

## 🎯 **Result**
- ✅ **Admin users** can now see and use "Edit User" buttons for all users
- ✅ **Manager users** can now see and use "Edit User" buttons for users in their team
- ✅ **Employee users** still cannot edit users (correct behavior)

## 🔐 **Permission Matrix**

| Role | Can Edit Users | Scope |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | All users (both teams) |
| **Manager** | ✅ Yes | Users in their team only |
| **Employee** | ❌ No | View only |

## 🧪 **How to Test**
1. Navigate to `/users` page
2. Look for blue "Edit User" buttons in the Actions column
3. Buttons should now be visible next to Activate/Deactivate and Delete buttons

**🎉 Issue Resolved!** The Edit User functionality is now fully accessible to authorized users.
